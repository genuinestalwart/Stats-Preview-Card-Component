## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS media queries
- Flexbox

}
```

Thanks to [Prasant](https://github.com/prasantdev) for reminding me about `opacity`. I mean, yeah. I knew about this property. But it didn't come to my mind that changing the opacity of an image can make the color under it visible. ðŸ˜‹
